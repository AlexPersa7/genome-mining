Natural products are encoded in a Biosynthtetic gene clusters (BGCs) in Bacteria. 
Genome mining is the action of analyze genomes with specialized algorithms 
designed to find some BGCs. Some of these clusters were dilligently characterized 
by chemicals last century.Right now we have extensive databases that contains 
information about which genes belong to BGCs, and some control sets of genes that doesnt. 
Since the era of next generation sequencing, genomes have been explored 
as a source of discovering for new BGCs.
