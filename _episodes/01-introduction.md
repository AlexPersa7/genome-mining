# Starting a genome mining project
Natural products are encoded in a Biosynthtetic gene clusters (BGCs) in Bacteria. 
Some of these clusters were dilligently characterized by chemicals last century.
Right now we have extensive databases that contains information about which genes
belong to BGCs, and some control sets of genes that doesnt. Since the era of next 
generation sequencing, genomes have been explored as a source of discovering for new BGCs.

# Some metadata 

# What is genome mining?
Genome mining is the action of analyze genomes with specialized algorithms 
designed to find some BGCs.
# Streptomyces are great Natural products producers
