## Other resources

We have seen how to carry on a genome mining project with some particular characteristics. However, each research project may need some deviations to these workflows. You may need to take use of RNA-Seq data, to search just for some specific domains instead of complete BGCs, or to combine metabolomics or proteomics with genomic data. Here we will provide a list of resources that are also useful for genome mining projects.
