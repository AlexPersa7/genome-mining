## MIBiG Database
The Minimum Information about a Biosynthetic Gene cluster (MIBiG) is a database that facilitates consistent and systematic deposition and retrieval of data on biosynthetic gene clusters. MIBiG provides a robust community standard for annotations and metadata on biosynthetic gene clusters and their molecular products. It will empower next-generation research on the biosynthesis, chemistry and ecology of broad classes of societally relevant bioactive secondary metabolites, guided by robust experimental evidence and rich metadata components.

### Browsing and Querying in the MIBiG database

Select "Search" on the upper right corner of the menu bar

> ![Forking Repositories]({{ page.root }}/fig/MIBiG_search.png)

For simple queries, such as "Streptococcus agalactiae" or searching for a specific strain you can use the "Simple search"  functionality.

> ![Forking Repositories]({{ page.root }}/fig/MIBiG_query.png)

For complex queries the database also provides a sophisticated query builder that allows querying on all antiSMASH annotations. To enable this function, click on "Build a query"

> ## Exercise 1: 
> You are going to do an experiment, you have two organisms one is likely to produce *themophilin 1277* and the other one *streptolysin S*, based on the table, which of these organisms is more likely to produce their respective secondary metabolite?

## antiSMASH database
The antiSMASH database provides researchers with an easy to use, up-to-date collection of annotated BGC data, which enable them to easily perform cross-genome analyses by offering complex queries on the datasets
