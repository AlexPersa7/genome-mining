## MIBiG Database
The Minimum Information about a Biosynthetic Gene cluster (MIBiG) is a database that facilitates consistent and systematic deposition and retrieval of data on biosynthetic gene clusters. MIBiG provides a robust community standard for annotations and metadata on biosynthetic gene clusters and their molecular products. It will empower next-generation research on the biosynthesis, chemistry and ecology of broad classes of societally relevant bioactive secondary metabolites, guided by robust experimental evidence and rich metadata components.

### Browsing and Querying in the MIBiG database

Select "Search" on the upper right corner of the menu bar

> ![Forking Repositories]({{ page.root }}/fig/MIBiG_search.png)

For simple queries, such as _Streptococcus agalactiae_ or searching f
or a specific strain you can use the "Simple search"  functionality.

> ![Forking Repositories]({{ page.root }}/fig/MIBiG_query.png)

For complex queries the database also provides a sophisticated query builder that allows querying on all antiSMASH annotations. To enable this function, click on "Build a query"

## antiSMASH database
The antiSMASH database provides researchers with an easy to use, up-to-date collection of annotated BGC data, which enable them to easily perform cross-genome analyses by offering complex queries on the datasets

### Browsing and Querying in the antiSMASH database
Select "Browse" on the top menu bar either you can select "Query" in the center

> ![Forking Repositories]({{ page.root }}/fig/antiSMASH_db.png)

For simple queries, such as "Streptococcus" or searching for a specific strain you can use the "Simple search" functionality.

For complex queries the database also provides a sophisticated query builder that allows querying on all antiSMASH annotations. To enable this function, click on "Build a query"

Lets use antiSMASH database to know the BGC contained in 
the _Streptococcus_ genomes. We will use R to visualize the data.  
First, lets ativate two libraries, `dplyr` for data manipulation 
and `ggplot2` for data visualization.      
  
~~~
library("dplyr")
library(ggplot2)
~~~
{: .language-r}

Now, lets store in a dataframe variable the content of the
_Strptococcus_ predicted BGC downloaded from antiSMASH-db  

~~~
df <- read.csv(file = "gm_workshop/data/antismash_db.csv", stringsAsFactors = TRUE)
~~~
{: .language-r}

Lets group the data by the variables Species and BGC.type:  
~~~
Streptococcus_antismash_df<-df %>%  group_by(Species,BGC.type) %>%  summarize(occurrences = n()) 
~~~
{: .language-r}

Now, Lets visualize the content of the Species column:  
~~~
Streptococcus_antismash_df$Species 
~~~
{: .language-r}  

Lets see our first visualization of the BGC content on a heatmap  .
~~~
ggplot(Streptococcus_antismash_df, aes(x = Species, y = BGC.type, fill = occurrences)) + geom_tile() 
~~~
{: .language-r}  

Lets improve legend legibility  
~~~
ggplot(Streptococcus_antismash_df, aes(x = Species, y = BGC.type, fill = occurrences)) + geom_tile() 
+ theme(axis.text.x=element_text(angle = 90))#+ scale_fill_gradient(low = "white", high = "steelblue")
~~~
{: .language-r}

Now lets restrict ourselves to _S. agalactiae_  
~~~
df_agalactiae<-Streptococcus_antismash_df[(Streptococcus_antismash_df$Species=="agalactiae"),]             
ggplot(df_agalactiae, aes( x = BGC.type, y = occurrences)) + geom_point() + theme(axis.text.x=element_text(angle = 90))
~~~
{: .language-r}

And finally, since _S. pneumonia_ lets restrict ourselves 
to BGC predicted less than 200 times.   
~~~
df2<-Streptococcus_antismash_df[!(Streptococcus_antismash_df$occurrences>200),]             
ggplot(df2, aes(x = BGC.type, y = occurrences)) + geom_tile() + theme(axis.text.x=element_text(angle = 90))+ scale_fill_gradient(low = "white", high = "steelblue")

ggplot(df2, aes(x = Species, y = BGC.type, fill = occurrences)) + geom_tile() + theme(axis.text.x=element_text(angle = 90))#+ scale_fill_gradient(low = "white", high = "steelblue")
~~~
