# antiSMASH database
The antiSMASH database provides researchers with an easy to use, up-to-date collection of state-of the art annotated BGC data, which enable them to easily perform cross-genome analyses by offering complex queries on the data sets


# MIBiG Database
The Minimum Information about a Biosynthetic Gene cluster (MIBiG) is a database that facilitates consistent and systematic deposition and retrieval of data on biosynthetic gene clusters. MIBiG provides a robust community standard for annotations and metadata on biosynthetic gene clusters and their molecular products. It will empower next-generation research on the biosynthesis, chemistry and ecology of broad classes of societally relevant bioactive secondary metabolites, guided by robust experimental evidence and rich metadata components.


What antiSMASH does is predict who would be the antibiotic producers of each organism, and what mibig shows us are organisms that have been tested with an experiment.
