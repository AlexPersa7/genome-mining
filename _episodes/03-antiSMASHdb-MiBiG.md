# antiSMASH database
The antiSMASH database provides researchers with an easy to use, up-to-date collection of annotated BGC data, which enable them to easily perform cross-genome analyses by offering complex queries on the datasets

## Browsing and Querying in the antiSMASH database
Select "Browse" on the top menu bar either you can select "Query" in the center

> ![Forking Repositories]({{ page.root }}/fig/antiSMASH_db.png)

For simple queries, such as "Streptococcus" or searching for a specific strain you can use the "Simple search" functionality.

> ![Forking Repositories]({{ page.root }}/fig/antiSMASH_search.png)

For complex queries the database also provides a sophisticated query builder that allows querying on all antiSMASH annotations. To enable this function, click on "Build a query"

# MIBiG Database
The Minimum Information about a Biosynthetic Gene cluster (MIBiG) is a database that facilitates consistent and systematic deposition and retrieval of data on biosynthetic gene clusters. MIBiG provides a robust community standard for annotations and metadata on biosynthetic gene clusters and their molecular products. It will empower next-generation research on the biosynthesis, chemistry and ecology of broad classes of societally relevant bioactive secondary metabolites, guided by robust experimental evidence and rich metadata components.

## Browsing and Querying in the MIBiG database

Select "Search" on the upper right corner of the menu bar

> ![Forking Repositories]({{ page.root }}/fig/MIBiG_search.png)

For simple queries, such as "Streptococcus agalactiae" or searching for a specific strain you can use the "Simple search"  functionality.

> ## Exercise 1: 
> You are going to do an experiment, you have two organisms one is likely to produce themophilin 1277 and the other substances streptolysin S, based on the table, which of these organisms is more likely to produce their respective secondary metabolite?

What antiSMASH does is predict who would be the antibiotic producers of each organism, and what mibig shows us are organisms that have been tested with an experiment.
