Data Carpentry’s aim is to teach researchers basic concepts, skills, and tools 
for working
with data so that they can get more done in less time, and with less pain. This workshop uses 
Data Carpentry's approach to
teach data management and analysis for genome mining research including: 
best practices for organization of bioinformatics projects and data, use
of command-line utilities, use of command-line tools to analyze sequence quality, 
use of R studio and use of R libraries to compare diversity between samples, 
and connecting to and using cloud computing. 

This workshop is designed to be taught over two full days of instruction.
